<b> This project has been finished and is left here for reference </b><br>
<p>First of all, maybe someone will ever use that code to learn assembly.
If you do, and have some questions feel free to ask me at szustarol123@gmail.com
This is assembled with FASM which I consider quite a solid choice.</p>
<p>
<U>This code uses win32 kernel functions so it only works on Windows, but should be compatible
with almost all versions, tested at Windows 7 and 10</U></p>

<br>
Yes, It is not commented. Wasn't thinking about such things when I was learning ASM, and yes, I could have used<br>
more advanced things like lodsb etc. but I have not considered them usefull then</b>
